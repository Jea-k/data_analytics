## Evolving Horizons: Unplugging the Future of Electric Vehicles


Welcome to the Evolving Horizons project, where we dive into the world of electric vehicles (EVs) and their impact on the automotive industry and the environment. This project aims to explore and analyze various aspects of electric vehicle adoption, performance, infrastructure, and environmental implications.

### Project Overview

In this project, we aim to achieve the following goals:

1. Investigate the patterns of electric vehicle adoption across time, comparing adoption rates among different regions.

2. Examine the factors influencing electric vehicle adoption, including pricing, range capabilities, and incentivization.

3. Contrast various electric vehicle manufacturers through an in-depth analysis of attributes such as acceleration, top speed, pricing, and efficiency.

4. Explore the progression of charging infrastructure by analyzing the distribution of charging stations, particularly in Germany.

5. Analyze the environmental impact of electric vehicles by delving into CO2 emissions associated with their use.

#### Data Sources
We have collected data from various reliable sources to carry out our analysis. The dataset includes information on electric vehicle adoption rates, manufacturer specifications, charging station locations, and environmental metrics.

#### Project Structure

The project is structured into the following sections:

##### Data Analysis: 
This section contains Jupyter notebooks that explore and analyze the data, along with visualizations that help illustrate our findings.

##### Charging Infrastructure: 
We delve into the distribution of charging stations across different regions, focusing on Germany's charging network.

##### Manufacturer Comparison: 
A comprehensive analysis comparing attributes of electric vehicles from different manufacturers.

##### Environmental Impact: 
An examination of CO2 emissions associated with electric vehicles.
