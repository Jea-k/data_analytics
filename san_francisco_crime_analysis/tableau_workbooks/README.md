# Tableau Dashboard Project Readme

## Project Description

In this project, you will create interactive dashboards using Tableau based on the San Francisco crime dataset. The goal is to analyze the data, answer questions, and provide insights through visualizations. You are required to create at least two dashboards combined into a story, incorporating various chart types, filters, and parameters to make the dashboard interactive. After completing the project, you should publish your dashboards/story on Tableau Public.

## Data

**Dataset:**
- [SF Crime Data](https://datasf.gitbook.io/datasf-dataset-explainers/sfpd-incident-report-2018-to-present) - The dataset contains information about crimes in San Francisco.

## Data Analytics Workflow

Follow these steps in your data analytics workflow:

1. **Define questions:** Develop your own questions or use exemplary questions provided.
3. **Retrieve data:** Read in a CSV file to Tableau.
4. **Data wrangling, exploration, and cleaning:** Perform feature engineering if needed.
5. **Analyze data:** Use Tableau visualizations to analyze the data and prepare visual answers to the questions.
6. **Present data to stakeholders:** Create Tableau dashboards and combine them into a story for presentation.

## Tips Regarding SF Crime Dataset

- Pay attention to data types, especially for "Point" (spatial) and "Report Datetime" (datetime).
- Consider questions like when crimes occur, their frequency over time, common crime types, affected neighborhoods, and mapping crime locations.
